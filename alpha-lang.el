;;; alpha-lang.el --- Major mode and flycheck integration for the
;;; alpha language implemented in UB's CSE443

;;; Commentary:
;; The flycheck mode for this language finds errors by running the
;; compiler and reading the error messages it returns.  Because error
;; messages are not implemented until Part 2 of the project, this is
;; likely not useful for Part 1.  Additionally, this means that you
;; will want to ensure your error messages are correct.

;; This searches for the compiler on the path with the name
;; "alpha-compiler".  I recommend symlinking your compiler to
;; somewhere in your PATH (i.e. /usr/local/bin)

;; alpha-mode is enabled for files with the extension ".alpha"
